**Agent Communication:**
- Agents share a unified knowledge base (vector DB + graph DB + time-series DB)
- Event-driven architecture: agents react to user actions and each other's outputs
- Conflict resolution via priority hierarchy and meta-agent arbitration
- Real-time data streaming between agents via message bus (Kafka/RabbitMQ)
- Federated learning for privacy-preserving cross-institutional insights
- Agent health monitoring and automatic failover for critical services
